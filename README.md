# Sentiment-Analysis-Imdb
I developed this project to explore sentiment analysis using an LSTM network. The model is trained on a subset of the IMDB dataset (5,000 samples) to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. This project helped me improve my understanding of text preprocessing, deep learning, and NLP techniques.
